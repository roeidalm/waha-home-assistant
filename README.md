## Usage

### Sending WhatsApp Notifications
Use the `notify` service in automations or scripts:

```yaml
service: notify.waha_whatsapp
data:
  message: "Hello from Home Assistant!"
  target: "+1234567890"  # Optional, can be a list
```

- `message`: The text to send
- `target`: Phone number(s) (with country code, e.g., `+1234567890`). If omitted, uses default recipients.

### Service Call Example
You can also use the direct service call:

```yaml
service: waha.send_message
data:
  phone: "+1234567890"
  message: "Hello from Home Assistant!"
```
