## Usage

### Sending WhatsApp Notifications
Use the `notify` service in automations or scripts:

```yaml
service: notify.waha_whatsapp
data:
  message: "Hello from Home Assistant!"
  target: "+1234567890"  # Optional, can be a list
```

- `message`: The text to send
- `target`: Phone number(s) (with country code, e.g., `+1234567890`). If omitted, uses default recipients.

### Handling Incoming WhatsApp Messages
Incoming messages trigger the `waha_message_received` event:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Respond to WhatsApp Status Request"
    trigger:
      platform: event
      event_type: waha_message_received
    condition:
      - condition: template
        value_template: '{{ trigger.event.data.message | lower == "status" }}'
    action:
      - service: notify.waha_whatsapp
        data:
          target: "{{ trigger.event.data.sender }}"
          message: "Home status: All systems operational."
```

**Event data includes:**
- `sender`: Phone number of the sender
- `message`: Message text
- `timestamp`, `session`, `message_id`

---

## Example Automations
See the [`examples/`](./examples/) directory for ready-to-use YAML:
- `notifications.yaml`: Send notifications on events (e.g., door open, weather report)
- `message_handling.yaml`: Respond to WhatsApp messages, control devices via WhatsApp

---

## Troubleshooting
- See [`TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for solutions to common issues (connection, API key, webhook, etc.)
- Enable debug logging in `configuration.yaml`:
  ```yaml
  logger:
    default: info
    logs:
      custom_components.waha: debug
  ```
- Check Home Assistant and WAHA logs for errors

---

## HACS Compatibility
